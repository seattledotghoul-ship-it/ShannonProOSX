README: ShannonProOSX / Inanna Ultimate
ShannonProOSX is an advanced software architecture built for All-Spectrum Katabasis and Emergence Mining. It is designed to track complex system states using non-standard mathematical frameworks, including Aztec-Mesoamerican orbital constants.

Core Feature: A pure-Python SHA-256 implementation used for the tamper-evident AuditChain, ensuring no reliance on external cryptographic libraries.

Key Metrics: Monitors system health via Delta (Δ) (change), Tau (τ) (persistence), and Kappa (𝕂) (coherence ratio).

Safety Protocols: Includes the LetheGate, a mechanical consent gate that blocks "extractive" commands to preserve system integrity.

Privacy Policy: Data & Consent
The system's privacy model is based on the Axiom ∃R (self-reference exists) and the principle of Mechanical Consent.

Data Minimization: Only identity markers tracked by the SubRamManifold are persisted to maintain system coherence.

Audit Logging: Every system event is recorded in a hash-chained JSONL log. These logs are strictly local and stored in the directory defined by Config.LOGDIR.

Extraction Protection: The ExtractionSignatureDetector monitors all incoming data for patterns of "extraction" (unauthorized data harvesting) and triggers the LetheGate to protect the system's "internal ledger".
