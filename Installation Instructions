Installation Instructions
To deploy the system on Windows, macOS, or Linux, follow these steps:

Environment Setup: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Dependencies: The core system requires NumPy for mathematical processing. Install it via:
pip install numpy

Directory Initialization: The script automatically generates the necessary filesystem structure upon first run:

~/inanna_ultimate/logs/ (AuditChain storage)

~/inanna_ultimate/data/ (Transaction and profile data)

~/inanna_ultimate/memory/ (Kernel state and identity markers)

Execution: Launch the primary interactive loop by running the script directly:
python ShannonProOSX.py

Verification: Upon startup, the script performs a "Pure-Python SHA-256 self-check" to verify the integrity of its cryptographic core.
